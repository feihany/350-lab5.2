This lab is to be done in class (completed outside of class if need
be). You can collaborate with your classmates, but you must identify
their names above, and you must submit **your own** lab as an knitted
HTML file on Canvas, by Thursday 10pm, this week.

**This week's agenda**: practicing version control with Git and Github

*If you do not have a <tt>GitHub</tt> account, you should sign up for
 one before proceeding.*

*If you have not installed and configured <tt>Git</tt>, you should do
 that before proceeding.*

Setup
===

- **1a.** Show us that you have a <tt>GitHub</tt> account. Create a
   repository on <tt>GitHub</tt> called "36-350". Then edit the code
   below so that we see the contents of <tt>README.md</tt> for that
   repo. To get the correct URL, do the following: go to your
   <tt>GitHub</tt> repo, click on <tt>36-350</tt> and then again on
   <tt>README.md</tt>, and click on the "Raw" button. Copy and paste
   the URL to the raw <tt>README.md</tt> file into the call to
   <tt>readLines()</tt> below.

   NOTE: If you encounter 404 errors make sure that your repo is
   public.
   
```{r}
readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feihany/350-lab5.2/master/README.md")
```



- **1b.** Show us that you have <tt>Git</tt> installed on your
    computer. Create a new project within **RStudio** that is tied to
    your "36-350" repo on <tt>GitHub</tt>. Then create a new <tt>R
    Script</tt> (and *not* an <tt>R Markdown</tt> file) in which you
    put <tt>print("Hello, world!")</tt>. Save this file (call it
    <tt>hello_world.R</tt>) to your local "36-350" repo. Stage the
    file, commit the file (and add a suitable commit message), and
    push the file to <tt>GitHub</tt>. Follow the steps above to find
    the URL to the raw file for <tt>hello_world.R</tt> and copy and
    paste that URL below in the call to <tt>source_url()</tt>. If
    everything works, "Hello, world!" should appear.


Git in Practice
===

In the following questions create a separate file
`lab_12_simulation.R` in the `36-350` repo to implement the following
tasks. After completing each task (in order) make a commit of the
necessary changes to complete the task. Each commit should be specific
and complete. Your commit messages should be informative.

For submission fill in the `readLines` calls with the link to the
patch file for the corresponding commit. You can find this link by
opening the commit on Github and appending ".patch" to the end of the
hash. Alternatively you can just copy and paste the commit's hash into
"https://github.com/user/repo/commits/hash.patch" where "user" is your
username and "repo" is your repo's name.

- **2a.** Write a function `generate_data(n, p)` which returns a list
    with the following elements: `covariates` which is a n-by-p matrix
    of draws from the standard normal distribution, and `responses`
    which is a vector of length n of draws from the standard normal.


- **2b.** Write a function `model_select(covariates, responses,
    cutoff)` which fits the linear regression `responses ~ covariates`
    and retains only those covariates whose coefficient p-values are
    less than or equal to `cutoff`. Then fit another regression using
    only the retained covariates and return the p-values from this
    reduced model. If there are no retained covariates return an empty
    vector. *HINT*: You can use indexing inside of formulas:
    `lm(responses ~ covariates[, c(1, 2)])` will fit a regression with
    only the first two covariates.


- **2c.** Write a function `run_simulation(n_trials, n, p, cutoff)`
    which uses the previous two functions to run `n_trials`
    simulations which uses data from `generate_data` in
    `model_select`, collects the returned p-values and displays a
    histogram of the p-values. Under the null hypothesis (that the
    regression coefficients are zero) these p-values should be
    uniformly distributed between 0 and 1; does this seem to be the
    case? Create and save figures for all combinations of `n = c(100,
    1000, 10000)`, `p = c(10, 20, 50)` and set `n_trials = 1000` and
    `cutoff = 0.05`. Don't include the figures in the commit, only the
    code. *HINT*: Write a `for` loop; alternatively the functions
    `expand.grid` and `m_ply` may prove useful.
